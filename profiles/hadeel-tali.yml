    description: |
      I worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer, where I was part of an Agile team focused on delivering high-quality software products. My responsibilities included analyzing user stories, designing and executing test cases, and performing manual testing across different stages of the development cycle. I actively participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives, ensuring clear communication between testers, developers, and project managers. I used tools like Trello for task management and reported bugs with clarity and precision to help the team resolve issues efficiently.
